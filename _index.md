# Courses
This website contains resources and helpful information for anyone taking DGM 2210 and 1610 at UVU. You don't need to be part of those classes to find this helpful though.

## How to use this website
This website was created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) editor focused around knowledge management. This website contains a knowledge graph similar to what Obsidian uses in order to help you navigate and find the resources you need.
